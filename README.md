# JDAK

## Introduction
JDAK is a Java-based tool that incorporates topic modeling and L1-norm based similarity metrics to recover data provenance. JDAK attempts to recover data provenance in two situations: the first situation being that a single file may have descended from multiple sources and the second situation being that a single file only descends from a single source.

## Required Libraries and Software
Two sets of libraries are used by JDAK: 

Apache Jena version 2.11.1 available from [https://jena.apache.org/download/](https://jena.apache.org/download/) and licensed under the MIT license (for more information on the apache 2.0 license, see [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)).

Jsoup version 1.7.3 available from [http://jsoup.org/download](http://jsoup.org/download) and licensed under the MIT license (for more information on the MIT license, see [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))

In order to use the full functionality of JDAK, a linux environment is required. If you are running JDAK on a Windows machine you will need to download and install cygwin. Cygwin can be downloaded from [https://cygwin.com/install.html](https://cygwin.com/install.html).
